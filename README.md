Google Maps PHP API
========

This is an API for Google maps written in PHP, the idea behind this is to give the developer the easiest control over the different options that Google Maps gives us.

As of now, we have this list of things working:

- Map shows up
- Set the center of the map
- Set different markers

What comes next
=========

In the near future my plans are to:

- Enable a search box for an address
- Remove jquery entirely so it's just plain JS
- Add all the options that this API gives us

How to help
========

If you feel interested in the project and want to be a part of it, just send me a pull request with some code and I'll look into it.

What's coming after this?
========

I'm planning on making this API also work for node.js systems, as a npm package, after that, I really don't know.
